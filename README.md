# **SEI: Tic-Tac-Toe**

This is the very beginning of my first project at GA Boston where I will be making the classic game Tic Tac Toe from scratch where the user will play against themselves. The game will consist of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.

The user should be able to sign up with an email, password and confirming the password to be able to play the game. The user should be able to sign in to play with the email and password they created and sign out of the game. They should be able to change their password as well and most importantly the player should be able to play the game smoothly.

The user should be able to switch turns between X and O on a game board and the application should display which side won or if there was a draw. An API will be used to create a new game, update the game by storing new moves, and visually display game statistics like how many games the user won.

## **User Stories**
- As a user I want to be able to sign in and sign up successfully.
- A a user I want to be able to change the password and sign out successfully.
- As a user I want to be able to create a new game and play it.
- As a user I want to be able to see whether I won, lost or if there was a tie.
- As a user I want to be able to see all the games played and the number of games won by the user.


## **Technologies Used**
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
-JavaScript
- JQuery

## **Unsolved Problems**
- I still need to be able to determine a tie.
- I still need to display the number of games won by the user.
